# CTA Bus and Train Tracker Documentation

Introduction
============

This is an HTML page which uses Javascript and jQuery to query the Chicago Transit Authority Bus and Train Tracker APIs and present the information (JSON file) in a large, clear format.

Reason for development:
----------------

This was developed as an alternative to the CTAs provided Digital Signage solution because of a few reasons:
	- The CTAs digital signage solution does not display multiple stops / busses and trains on the same page
	-The CTAs solution can take up quite a bit of time to iterate over all necessary slides
	-The CTAs solution shows many next busses / trains, whereas this solution only shows the next two.

Bugs / To Do:
